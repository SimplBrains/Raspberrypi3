Elevate your permissions to root user to allow IO access

sudo -i


Setup to control pin as output
Substitute 23 in the following commands for your GPIO number (GPIO, not pin number)


echo "23" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/direction


Control Output State

echo "1" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/value
echo "0" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/value
Setup to read pin as an input


Substitute 23 in the following commands for your GPIO number (GPIO, not pin number)


echo "23" > /sys/class/gpio/export
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/direction


Read its state

cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio23/value
To Release A Pin Afterwards

echo "23" > /sys/class/gpio/unexport
