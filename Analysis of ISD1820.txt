Analysis of ISD1820

-> It is a output device.
Sound received from mic remains on chip. It can be transferred over to raspberry/arduino, but only in analog form. That means it will be in the form of numbers if received serially.
To achieve this, put ISD1820 in FT mode and then put speaker output (SP) to serial receiver of arduino(after dumping serial code on Arduino offcourse)

We can control recording(REC), complete playback(P-E), and playback till you provide high(P-L) through program. 

Uses-
1. Any alarm system
2. Greeting card wish
