Steps to Write hex file

1.Open AVR Studio
2. New Project > AVR GCC > C Executable Project > Select device and click finish. Project is created.
3. Go to build and hit 'build<project_name>'. Hex file will be created after removing compilation problems.
4.Copy the hex file to Raspberry and run following command
sudo avrdude -c linuxgpio -p atmega8 -v -U flash:w:/home/pi/test2.hex:i

This will install the firmware on AVR.
(For Raspberry set-up, see reference document.)
